"""
Library support for the safety pin. The safety pin is a feature on all payloads.
It checks whatever the payload is installed or not and if not running from a target, it won't run.
All the payloads that come with snr do use the safety pin.
For custom written payloads, you must use require_lack_of_safety_pin at the very
start of your payload. To ensure your payload doesn't run in the host accidentally.
